Hi and welcome back to App Inventor's Hour of Code.

00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.398
- I am Emily.
- And I am Shay.

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:22.228
In our last video we showed you how to make the Talk To Me app: You push a button and the phone talks to you.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.593
- So cool. 
- Well, we had to start somewhere!

00:00:25.726 --> 00:00:27.729
I am ready to get to the cool stuff.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.742
Okay, now we are going to extend the Talk To me app so that it responds when we shake it and also so the user can input their own text.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:37.500
&gt;Stop shaking me!&lt;

00:00:37.652 --> 00:00:43.776
- Cool enough for you now?
- I see endless opportunities. I can go on a run and get constant encouragement.

00:00:44.238 --> 00:00:50.717
Great! So we are gonna get started and the great thing is, this takes only a couple of minutes because App Inventor makes it really easy.

00:00:50.863 --> 00:00:56.193
Is your phone talking to you? Well, hang on, because it's about to get even more fun.

00:00:56.348 --> 00:01:04.930
We left off with our Talk To Me app in the blocks editor. Right now we need to go back into the designer to add another component.

00:01:05.088 --> 00:01:12.772
We want to extend Talk To Me so that the phone speaks when you shake it. To do that we need an accelerometer component.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:23.536
Click on the sensors drawer and drag out an accelerometer sensor. This is another non-visible component - so it drops down to the bottom of the screen.

00:01:25.514 --> 00:01:28.553
That's all we need for right now! Go back over to the blocks editor.

00:01:28.677 --> 00:01:34.429
As you develop your apps you will move back and forth between the designer and the blocks editor quite a bit.

00:01:35.724 --> 00:01:41.039
We now need a block for when the phone is shaking. This is also called an event handler.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.806
Drag out the "when AcceleromenterSensor1.Shaking" block.

00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:49.907
So, when this event is triggered that's when the phone is being shaken.

00:01:50.106 --> 00:01:54.264
What do we want to happen then? We want the phone to talk to us, right?

00:01:54.367 --> 00:02:00.523
So, we already know the blocks that handle that - the same blocks that we have inside the "Button1.Click" event.

00:02:01.156 --> 00:02:07.061
Here is a cool shortcut that will help you program in App Inventor even more quickly. You can copy and paste blocks.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.856
Click on the purple TextToSpeech block. Hit the key combination your computer for copy just like you would do with text.

00:02:15.043 --> 00:02:21.641
And then hit the key combination for paste. Voilà, you have a new set of the TextToSpeech and text blocks.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:26.245
Drag this new set down into the accelerometer shaking event block.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:33.087
If you had any trouble copying and pasting blocks, that's okay. You can also drag out new blocks from the drawers on the left.

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:41.670
Remember, we got the TextToSpeech.Speak block from TextToSpeech and we got the plain text block from the built-in text drawer.

00:02:42.777 --> 00:02:49.400
So, right now, the phone will speak out loud if you shake it. But wouldn't it be much more fun if the phone says something about been shaken?

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:54.574
Let's put in a funny phrase. I am going to type in "Stop Shaking Me!".

00:02:56.467 --> 00:02:59.307
Okay, try it out! Pick up your phone and shake it.

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:00.915
&gt;Stop Shaking Me!&lt;

00:03:01.071 --> 00:03:11.356
So, our app is pretty cool, right? But wait! There is one more thing to add. Imagine sharing this app with your friends: Don't you think it would be a lot more fun if they can tell the phone what to say?

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:19.268
To set this up go back into the designer, go to the user interface drawer and pull out a text box.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:25.175
Let's rearrange that a bit and put the button under the text box.

00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:27.295
Okay, guess what...

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.644
Back to the blocks.

00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:36.131
Click on TextBox1 and look at the blocks it has. We now want to change what happens when the button is clicked.

00:03:36.334 --> 00:03:42.290
Instead of saying a fixed phrase we want the app to say whatever the user has typed into the text box.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:51.827
Scroll all the way down to the green blocks that we call "getters" and "setters" because they allow you to get and set the properties of the component.

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:58.716
You want to get the text that has been typed into the box. So you need the getter block for "TextBox1.Text".

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:02.626
Put that block inside the "when Button1.Click" block.

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:11.710
To do this you have to throw away the old text block and then click this new TextBox1.Text block in its place.

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:20.292
Try your app out again. When you click in the blank text box on your phone your keyboard will come up and you can type in whatever you want.

00:04:20.425 --> 00:04:23.665
Then, click "Talk To Me" and see what happens.

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:24.981
&gt;Hello World&lt;

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:31.922
There are some cool ways to extend this app. See the written tutorial for some great ideas for making it even better.

00:04:32.076 --> 00:04:37.077
If you had any trouble with this tutorial you can view the written version on our website.

00:04:38.727 --> 00:04:41.259
&gt;Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!&lt;
- Aw man, we made a real app!

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:44.295
&gt;Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!&lt;
- That's kind of annoying!

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:45.588
&gt;Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!&lt;
- You made it!

00:04:45.717 --> 00:04:46.955
Oh right.

00:04:47.092 --> 00:04:52.926
Well you are gonna have a ball with our next step because we're gonna show you how to make a ball roll around the screen when you fling it with your finger.

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.662
&gt;Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!&lt;
- Can't wait!

00:04:55.831 --> 00:04:57.795
&gt;Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop Shaking Me!&lt;

00:04:58.067 --> 00:05:07.133
